# Pok√©mon Rumble World (3DS) replacement server
Includes both the authentication and secure servers

## Compiling

### Setup
Install [Go](https://go.dev/doc/install) and [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads), then clone and enter the repository

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/PretendoNetwork/pokemon-rumble-world
$ cd pokemon-rumble-world
```

### Compiling using `go`
To compile using Go, `go get` the required modules and then `go build` to your desired location. You may also want to tidy the go modules, though this is optional

```bash
$ go get -u
$ go mod tidy
$ go build -o build/pokemon-rumble-world
```

The server is now built to `build/pokemon-rumble-world`

When compiling with only Go, the authentication servers build string is not automatically set. This should not cause any issues with gameplay, but it means that the server build will not be visible in any packet dumps or logs a title may produce

To compile the servers with the authentication server build string, add `-ldflags "-X 'main.serverBuildString=BUILD_STRING_HERE'"` to the build command, or use `make` to compile the server

### Compiling using `make`
Compiling using `make` will read the local `.git` directory to create a dynamic authentication server build string, based on your repositories remote origin and current commit

Install `make` either through your systems package manager or the [official download](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/). We provide two different rules; A `default` rule which compiles [using `go`](#compiling-using-go), and a `docker` rule which compiles [using `docker`](#compiling-and-running-using-docker-preferred). Please refer to each sections setup instructions before continuing with your preferred rule

To build using `go`

```bash
$ make
```

The server is now built to `build/pokemon-rumble-world`

## Configuration
All configuration options are handled via environment variables

`.env` files are supported
